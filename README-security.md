# Security Implementation Requirements

1. Create a KMS key in AWS:
```bash
aws kms create-key --description "Password encryption key"
```

2. Add the KMS key ID to your environment variables:
```
KMS_KEY_ID=your-key-id-here
```

3. Update the IAM role for your Lambda function to include these permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:key/KEY_ID"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Follow the implementation guide in password-encryption.md for client-side implementation details.

5. Make sure to:
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Set up proper CORS settings
   - Keep your KMS key secure and rotate it periodically
